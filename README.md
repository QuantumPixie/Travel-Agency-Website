# Travel Agency Project

## Project Description

Welcome to my Travel Agency project. 
This web application aims to provide users with a seamless experience while exploring various destinations, making inquiries, and booking trips. 
The project is designed to include a landing page, destinations gallery, individual destination page, contact form, and a contact form success page.


### Pages Created:

1. **Destinations Gallery Page:**
   - Displays a gallery of 12 destination images.
   - The first item links to the Individual Destination Page.
   - Visually changes on hover to indicate clickability.

2. **Individual Destination Page:**
   - Displays at least one destination image.
   - Includes a 3-paragraph description and a trip booking form.
   - Includes a link back to the Destinations Gallery Page.

3. **Contact Form Page:**
   - Allows users to submit inquiries.
   - Required fields: name, email, phone number, and message textarea.
   - Includes a submit button.

4. **Contact Form Success Page:**
   - Displays upon form submission.
   - Thanks the user for their inquiry.

### Visual Consistency:

All new pages are visually consistent with the existing landing page. They are optimized for both mobile screens and desktops.

### Additional Information:

- Homepage includes links to the Destinations and Contact Form pages.
- Page titles are included in the header (e.g., "Contact Us", "Destinations").
- Smaller header section without the booking form.
